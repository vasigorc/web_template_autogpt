# Web-Template AutoGPT

## Context

This repository is part of my following along the
[Build an AutoGPT Code Writing AI Tool With Rust and GPT-4](https://www.udemy.com/course/autogpt-gpt4-code-writing-ai) Udemy course.
It provides a web server template that is used by GPT-4 for generating web site implementations.

The project itself is a To-Do project, but the idea is to challenge GPT-4 use it to build different
kind of websites.

## Technology used

Among others, it leverages the following Rust libraries:

- [actix-web](https://actix.rs/)
- reqwest
- [tokio](https://tokio.rs/)
- [serde_json](https://serde.rs/)
- async-trait
